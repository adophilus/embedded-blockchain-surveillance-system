# Materials (Organized)

The Materials section has been organized into three distinct pages for better navigation:

- [Materials: Overview](/project-report/materials-overview) - High-level system components overview with cost breakdown and visual references
- [Materials: Software](/project-report/materials-software) - Software components, frameworks, tools, and interface visualizations
- [Materials: Hardware](/project-report/materials-hardware) - Hardware components, specifications, and implementation diagrams

Additionally, a dedicated [System Images](/project-report/images) page provides visual representations of all system components, including:
- Individual hardware component images (ESP32-CAM, PIR sensor, 7.4V battery, etc.)
- System diagrams (circuit schematic, coupled implementation)
- Software interface screenshots (IPFS dashboard)
